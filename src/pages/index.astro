      Hi, I’m Kortin — a front-end engineer with a deep focus on
      building reliable, thoughtful, and scalable user interfaces. I currently
      work at <LinkPreviewer url="https://cloud.baidu.com" client:only
        >cloud.baidu.com</LinkPreviewer
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      With over <span class="text-orange-500">{new Date().getFullYear() - 2020} years</span
      > years of professional experience, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects,
      including data development platforms, data asset management systems, and large-scale
      data visualization tools. These experiences shaped my ability to turn messy,
      high-dimensional information into clear, intuitive interfaces that teams can
      actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      My day-to-day work spans modern front-end engineering:
      <strong>
        React 19, Next.js 15, Vue.js, TypeScript, monorepo architecture with
        Turborepo, pnpm workspaces, motion design, performance tuning,
      </strong>
      and the practical realities of delivering products in enterprise
      environments. Recently, I’ve also been contributing to an AI Infra
      platform — covering model management, API gateways, usage tracking,
      dataset operations, fine-tuning workflows, and observability tools like
      Langfuse. This has broadened my perspective on how front-end engineering
      supports AI-native systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy tackling problems that involve large systems, tricky edge cases, or complex states. Code for me isn’t decoration — it’s a tool to reduce complexity, create clarity, and make technology easier for people to interact with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I’m a long-time <span class="text-red-400">Nintendo</span
      >&nbsp;<span class="text-blue-400">Switch</span> fan.
      The <i>Legend of Zelda</i> series has followed me through different stages of life, offering both comfort and creative inspiration. I also love films, especially science fiction that challenges how we think about reality and the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, I’m a builder who appreciates both craft and curiosity — always learning, always refining, and always looking for meaningful ways to make digital experiences smoother, smarter, and more human.
